# Kalaha

Kalah, also called Kalaha or Mancala, is a game in the mancala family imported in the United States by William Julius Champion, Jr. in 1940. <br/>This game is sometimes also called "Kalahari", possibly by false etymology from the Kalahari desert in Namibia.<br/><br/>
The game provides a Kalah board and a number of stones or counters. The board has 6 small pits, called houses, on each side; and a big pit, called a kalaha, at each end. The objective of the game is to capture more stones than one's opponent - [Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Kalah)

## Game Play
The player who begins with the first move picks up all the stones in anyone of his own six pits, and sows the stones on to the right, one in each of the following pits, including his own Kalaha. No stones are put in the opponents' Kalaha. If the player's last stone lands in his own Kalaha, he gets another turn. This can be repeated several times before it's the other player's turn.

## Capturing Stones
During the game the pits are emptied on both sides. Always when the last stone lands in an own empty pit, the player captures his own stone and all stones in the opposite pit (the other players' pit) and puts them in his own Kalaha.

## The Game Ends
The game is over as soon as one of the sides run out of stones. The player who still has stones in his pits keeps them and puts them in his/hers Kalaha. Winner of the game is the player who has the most stones in his Kalaha.
